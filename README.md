🧠 Key Features:
	•	Advanced feature engineering (technical, macroeconomic, sentiment, candlestick)
	•	Regression models: OLS, LASSO, Ridge, ElasticNet, LARS
	•	Tree models: Random Forest, Bagging, Gradient Boosting
	•	PCA transformation and p-value-based feature selection
	•	Custom strategy simulation with position sizing, stop-loss, and leverage

📊 Final Outcome:

“Our Strategy” delivered the highest return and best risk-adjusted performance vs. LASSO, Ridge, and tree-based benchmarks.
